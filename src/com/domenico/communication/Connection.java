/**
 * Abstract class that represents a connection between a client and a server or in general between two endpoints.
 * It implements the protocol used by the two parts to communicate. The protocol is the following: first thing sent is
 * the data's length and then the data itself. This class uses ConnectionData objects to represent the data
 * that should be sent or which is received.
 * A subclass of this class should implement the write(), read() and endConnection() method. That methods are dependent
 * of the network protocol used (TCP or UDP for example).
